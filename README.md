# Gradescope MCP Server

An [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for
[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) that exposes course management,
grading, regrade review, statistics, and AI-assisted grading workflows to MCP
clients.

The server is designed for instructors and TAs who want to use AI agents with
real Gradescope data while keeping write operations gated behind explicit
confirmation.

This repository also includes a reusable local skill at
`skills/gradescope-assisted-grading/SKILL.md` for human-approved grading
workflows.

## Current Status

- 34 MCP tools
- 3 MCP resources
- 7 MCP prompts
- 30 automated tests
- Python 3.10+
- Package manager: `uv`

## What The Project Provides

### Read-oriented workflows
- Course discovery and assignment listing
- Assignment outline parsing for online and scanned-PDF assignments
- Roster inspection with a custom HTML parser
- Submission listing for multiple assignment types
- Grading progress, rubric context, answer groups, regrades, and statistics
- Workflow helpers that cache grading artifacts and answer-key snapshots to
  `/tmp`

### Write-oriented workflows
- Uploading submissions
- Setting student extensions
- Modifying assignment dates
- Renaming assignments
- Applying grades
- Creating, updating, and deleting rubric items
- Batch grading answer groups

All write-capable tools are preview-first and require `confirm_write=True`
before any mutation is executed.

## Architecture

### Entry points
- `src/gradescope_mcp/__main__.py`: loads `.env`, configures logging, runs the
  FastMCP server
- `src/gradescope_mcp/server.py`: registers all tools, resources, and prompts

### Authentication
- `src/gradescope_mcp/auth.py`: maintains a singleton `GSConnection`
- Credentials come from `GRADESCOPE_EMAIL` and `GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD`
- `.env` is loaded automatically when starting with `python -m gradescope_mcp`

### Tool modules
- `tools/courses.py`: course listing and roster parsing
- `tools/assignments.py`: assignment listing and assignment write operations
- `tools/submissions.py`: uploads, submission listing, grader discovery
- `tools/extensions.py`: extension reads and writes
- `tools/grading.py`: outline parsing, score exports, grading progress
- `tools/grading_ops.py`: grading context, writes, rubric CRUD, navigation
- `tools/grading_workflow.py`: `/tmp` artifacts, answer keys, readiness, page
  caching, smart reading
- `tools/answer_groups.py`: AI-assisted answer-group inspection and batch writes
- `tools/regrades.py`: regrade listing and detail inspection
- `tools/statistics.py`: assignment statistics
- `tools/safety.py`: preview-first confirmation helpers for mutations

## Important Behavior And Constraints

### Write safety
- Mutating tools return a preview when `confirm_write=False`
- The actual change only happens with `confirm_write=True`
- Rubric edits and deletions can cascade to existing grades
- `tool_grade_answer_group` can affect many submissions at once and needs extra
  care

### Submission IDs
- `tool_get_assignment_submissions` returns assignment-level Global Submission
  IDs
- Grading tools require Question Submission IDs
- Use `tool_list_question_submissions`, `tool_get_next_ungraded`, or grading
  context tools to get the correct IDs

### Scoring direction
- Gradescope questions may be `positive` or `negative` scoring
- Rubric weights are stored as positive numbers in both modes
- The scoring mode determines whether a checked rubric item adds or deducts
  points

### Scanned / handwritten assignments
- Structured reference answers are often unavailable
- This is expected, not necessarily a parsing failure
- The workflow helpers are built to use crop regions, full pages, adjacent pages,
  rubric text, and user-provided reference notes

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### 2. Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuanpeng-Li/gradescope-mcp.git
cd gradescope-mcp
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your Gradescope credentials.

### 3. Run locally
```bash
uv run python -m gradescope_mcp
```

### 4. Configure an MCP client

Example client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gradescope": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/gradescope-mcp",
        "python",
        "-m",
        "gradescope_mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GRADESCOPE_EMAIL": "your_email@example.com",
        "GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Debug with MCP Inspector
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run python -m gradescope_mcp
```

### 6. Run tests
```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

## Assisted Grading Skill

The repository includes one project-local skill:

- `gradescope-assisted-grading`

It is intended for:
- preview-first grading
- rubric review before mutation
- scanned exam grading
- answer-group triage
- explicit human approval before any grade write

### Install the skill locally
```bash
mkdir -p .agent/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/skills/gradescope-assisted-grading" .agent/skills/gradescope-assisted-grading
```

If you prefer copying:

```bash
mkdir -p .agent/skills
cp -R skills/gradescope-assisted-grading .agent/skills/
```

### Verify installation
```bash
ls .agent/skills/gradescope-assisted-grading
cat .agent/skills/gradescope-assisted-grading/SKILL.md
```

Invoke it from a client with:
- `Use the gradescope-assisted-grading skill`
- `$gradescope-assisted-grading`

## Development Notes

- `AGENT.md` summarizes the current architecture and maintenance expectations
- `DEVLOG.md` records the implementation history
- `OPERATIONS_LOGS/RECORDS.md` is the mutation log template for real-account
  testing

## Known Caveats

1. Gradescope behavior differs across assignment types; several tools rely on
   HTML parsing or reverse-engineered endpoints.
2. Roster parsing uses a custom parser because the upstream library parser is
   unreliable when sections are present.
3. Some assignment types do not support the extensions API even for staff users.
4. Scanned assignments usually do not provide a structured answer key.
5. Question grading requires Question Submission IDs, not assignment-level Global
   Submission IDs.
